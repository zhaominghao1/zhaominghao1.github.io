== About Me
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics. I have a strong foundation in calculus, probability theory, econometrics, statistical inference, and numerical optimization, and I am proficient in Python, R, MATLAB, STATA, Java, and \LaTeX.

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have gained research experience as a Research Assistant in the UC San Diego Economics Department under the supervision of Ph.D. candidate Philip Hoxie. My work spans data collection, empirical analysis, and literature review. I have also completed multiple independent projects in causal inference, economic forecasting, policy analysis, and game theory.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of computation, economics, and applied mathematics, with a particular focus on health economics and labor markets. I am also passionate about teaching and have served as a teaching assistant and tutor for several mathematics and economics courses at UC San Diego.
