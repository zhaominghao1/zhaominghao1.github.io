    <section id="greetings"><h1>Greetings</h1><p> Hi there, I am a fourth year undergraduate student double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics. I have a strong foundation in Calculus, Econometrics/Statistics, Probability, and Numerical Optimization. I am also familiar with Python, R, Java, STATA, MATLAB, and Latex. Throughout my undergraduate career, I have gained research experience from working as a Research Assistant in the Economics department under the supervision of PhD Candidate Philip Hoxie. My work mostly ranges from data analysis (collecting, visualizing and interpreting) to literature review. I also have conducted a number of independent projects focusing on Causal Inference, Economic Forecasting, Policy Analysis and Game Theory. I am passionate about using my skills in Mathematics and Computation to solve problems in Health Economics. I have strong interests in teaching, and I have served as a teaching assistance for various Economic and Mathematics in UC San Diego.</p></section>

        College Admissions and Replicator Dynamics </a> </h2>
      <p> In this project, we examine the college admission process through mathematical
modeling and game theory. Unlike the classic Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm
described in Roth 1985, which provides a static one-time solution, we explore how
colleges dynamically adapt their admission strategies over time based on the outcomes
of previous application cycles. Using a simplified model involving two colleges and a
continuous population of students, we apply replicator dynamics to capture the evolu-
tion of strategic preferences in a competitive environment. The model is governed by
a system of ordinary differential equations, where the frequency of a college's strategy
increases if its payoff exceeds the average. We analyze the resulting dynamics and
investigate conditions under which strategies stabilize or fluctuate. This framework
provides insight into how institutional behavior in college admissions may shift over
time in response to competition, perceived utility, and feedback from earlier cycles.
Our findings suggest that even in a simplified system, dynamic strategy adjustment
can lead to nontrivial long-term patterns that mirror real world behavior.
