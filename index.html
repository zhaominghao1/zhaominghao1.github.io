    <section id="greetings"><h1>Greetings</h1><p> Hi there, I am a fourth year undergraduate student double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics. 
      I have a strong foundation in Calculus, Econometrics/Statistics, Probability, and 
      Numerical Optimization. I am also familiar with Python, R, Java, STATA, MATLAB, and Latex. 
      Throughout my undergraduate career, I have gained research experience from working 
      as a Research Assistant in the Economics department under the supervision of PhD Candidate 
      <a href="https://www.philiphoxie.com/" target="_blank"> Philip Hoxie </a> My work mostly ranges from 
      data collection, analysis to literature review. I also have conducted a number of independent projects focusing 
      on Causal Inference, Economic Forecasting, Policy Analysis and Game Theory. 
      I am passionate about using my skills in Mathematics and Computation to solve problems in Health Economics. 
      I have strong interests in teaching, and have served as a teaching assistant for various 
      Econ and Math courses in UC San Diego.</p></section>

        1. College Admissions and Replicator Dynamics (UCSD MATH_111A)
      </a>
    </h2>
      <p> We examined the college admission process through mathematical
modeling and game theory and explored how colleges dynamically adapt their admission strategies over time based on the outcomes
of previous application cycles. We applied replicator dynamics to capture the evolu-
tion of strategic preferences in a competitive environment. The model is governed by
a system of ordinary differential equations, where the frequency of a college's strategy
increases if its payoff exceeds the average. We analyze the resulting dynamics and
investigate conditions under which strategies stabilize or fluctuate. This framework
provides insight into how institutional behavior in college admissions may shift over
time in response to outcomes from earlier cycles. Our findings suggest that even in a simplified system, dynamic strategy adjustment
can lead to nontrivial long-term patterns that mirror real world behavior.

      2. An Empirical Study of Monetary Policy on Wyoming State (UCSD ECON_112)
    </a>
  </h2>
    <p> In this project, we utilized Time-Series metrics to determine whether the causa relationship between monetary policy 
      and economic activity indicatiors. We plotted the impulse response functions of the Federal Funds Rate and growth rate of real 
      GDP and unemployment rate respectively. In the end we deduced a positive causal effect on GDP growth and a negative one on unemployment,
      which is consistent with the predictions from Macroeconomic models.

    <p> We utilized Machine Learning Techniques to predict the total wealth of US individuals using a representative sample. 
      The models ranges from linear regression, ridge regression, forward/backward stepwise selection, Lasso and polynomial 
      regession and were implemented in R. We selected the model that has the highest predictive accuracy using cross validation 
      and comparing the predictive error.
